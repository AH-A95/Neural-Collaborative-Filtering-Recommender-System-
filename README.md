# Neural-Collaborative-Filtering-Recommender-System-
This project uses a Neural Network to build a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System, using explicit data. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, and many more use all kinds of recommender systems to recommend movies, items, and songs to their users. In practice, these companies use a hybrid of many model achitectures, feedback types, and filtering types, but this project delves specifically into one of the kinds of models these companies use.
